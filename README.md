In the past, the librarians used notebooks to record the data of the person who borrowed a particular book. It was tough to trace each book as the
manual system contained redundant data in the file-based system. This system will ensure both
students and librarians trace the library's availability of books. It also allows librarians and
students to search for books by searching the book ID.
If the task is carried out manually, it will include more mistakes. These can be prevented by allowing the system to track important information such as book
titles, authors and bookID. The system will systematically organize all the books in the library by
sorting them into different categories so that librarians and students can search them easily. Thus, this system
is created to allow the library management system's smoothness by minimizing errors.
